### First of all, a mini mind map of what we will be doing to style this card is

* we need a container for the card, which has a nice `border-radius` and `box-shadow` .
    
* Then inside the container, we have a circular picture ( because we have made it's `border-radius` 50% ).
    
* After that, we have a heading.
    
* Then a paragraph for description ( its text is aligned in the center ).
    
* In last, we have a nice medium-sized button with a black background and white text.
    

### Writing the code \[HTML\] for the card

Create an HTML file for the webpage and write the content for the card. or say make the skeleton of the card.

```xml
<div class="card-container">
            <img src="https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/landscape-shot-beautiful-cholatse-mountains-body-water-khumbu-nepal_181624-24825.jpg?size=626&ext=jpg"
                alt="landscape">
            <div class="card-content">
                <h2>Beautiful Landscape</h2>
                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur 
                        adipisicing elit. Quisquam, quod.</p>
                <a href="#">Read More</a>
            </div>
        </div>
```

Here, I have created the card container using `div` tag and gave it the class of `card-container` .

Then used `img` tag to show an image from an external source, using its URL.

Then I created a `div` with a class of `card-content` that would contain the content of the card like a heading, description, and a link.

### Writing CSS for the Card --&gt; card-Container

First of all, we will style the card container, by selecting the `div` element with its class name

```css
.card-container {
  width: 300px;
  height: 350px;
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

Every property is self-explanatory.

* `width` sets the width of the card,
    
* `height` sets the height of the card,
    
* `background-color` sets the background of the card ( `#fff` means white in hex ),
    
* `border-radius` makes all four corners of the card a bit circular,
    
* `box-shadow` gives the shadow to the card,
    
* `margin` sets the spacing outside of the card,

* `padding` sets the spacing inside the card

    `text-align` property sets the alignment of texts inside the card. It also sets the alignment of the text of the inner children.
    

### Styling the picture of the card

We will select the `img` tag by descendant selector because `img` tag is a descendant of `.card-container`.

```css
.card-container img {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

Explanation of the above code:

* `width` as usual sets the width of the element ( in this case sets the width of img )
    
* `height` same as `width` , it sets the height of the element
    
* `border-radius` also takes the value in percentage, and makes the element circular ( if the element is square means its width is equal to its height ).
    
* `object-fit` property resizes and crops the image to fit the dimensions given to it, without `cover` value, the image will get stretched because the actual image is not a square.
    

### Giving spacing above and below `p` tag,

```css
.card-container p {
  padding-top: 20px;
  padding-bottom: 20px;
}
```

Here we selected `p` tag and gave spacing using `padding-top` and `padding-bottom` property. You can also use `margin-top` and `margin-bottom` for the same task.

### Let's style our Big Black Button

```css
.card-container a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #fff;
  background-color: #000;
  border: 1px solid #000;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
```

Here, I have used an anchor tag not a button.

So, we will make the anchor tag look like a button.

An anchor tag already comes with some styling, its color is blue and it has an underline.

* `text-decoration` is given the value of `none` to make the underline disappear.
    
* `color` sets the color of the text.
    
* `background-color` sets the background of the button.
    
* `border` takes three value values, `1px` defines the thickness of the border, `solid` means the border line will be a continuous line, `#000` defines the color of the border.
    
* `padding` defines the spacing inside the button, first `10px` sets the upper and bottom padding, second `20px` sets the left and right padding.
    
* `border-radius` makes the corner of the button curvy.
    

### Adding Hover Effect to the Button

```css
.card-container a:hover {
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #000;
}
```

When you hover over ( take the cursor over the element) any element, CSS senses that event and applies the styling if it is defined on that element.

So we define the styling on hover of any element using `:hover` selector.

In our case, when an element is hovered, its text color becomes black and the background becomes white.
