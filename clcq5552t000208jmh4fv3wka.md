# Links and Navigation in HTML  ü§ù

You must have seen links, mostly blue color underlined texts starting with `https:` and ending with `.com` or `.in` etc. somewhere on your mobiles and web browsers. They usually take you to another screen or website and can also navigate within the page.

**A typical example of links could be search results on Google's webpage:**

### How to put a link on your webpage? ü§î

You can use an anchor tag for that `<a> </a>` .

**The code:**

```xml
<a href="https://google.com"> click me to go on google home page </a>
<br>
<a href="https://w3schools.com" target="_blank"> Click me to go on W3Schools home page </a>
```

[Check out the live preview of the above code](https://webd-essentials.github.io/HTML5/links-and-navigation#intro).

**The output of the above code:**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1673002494655/6d00d72b-3108-4fd4-ae12-d931cb9fa904.png )

**The breakdown of the code:**

* `<a> </a>` anchor tag is an inline-level tag, that's why I have used `<br>` tag to display them in separate lines.
    
* `href` attribute takes the address ( say link or URL ) of that other website.
    
* `target="_blank"` attribute opens that link in a new tab.
    

### Create more pages for your website and link them with `<a> </a>` tag üñáÔ∏è

Create four HTML files in your website's folder. (You can create HTML files with any name you want ). Each HTML file is a separate page of a website.

* `index.html` , this would be the homepage of your website
    
* `stories.html` , a page to write stories
    
* `about.html` , another page to write about yourself
    
* `projects.html` , a page to enlist all your projects.
    

**How I will connect these pages?**

I will use an anchor tag on each page and will give relative paths of other pages to `href` attribute, like `href="./projects.html` , `href="./stories.html"` etc.

For example: If I have two pages `index.html` and `stories.html` and I want to connect them.

**A visual representation:**

So in `index.html` , I will use an anchor tag and pass the path of `stories` page as `./stories.html` , because both the files are in the same directory.

```xml
<a href="./stories.html"> Go to Home Page </a>
```

and in `stories.html` , I would pass the path of `index` page as `./index.html` .

```xml
<a href="./index.html"> Go to Home Page </a>
```

**Let's say I have another file** `bikes.html` **in** `vehicles` **folder inside my website's folder.**

and I want to connect the `bikes` page to `index` page.

I would write the path in `index.html` as:

```xml
<a href="./vehicles/bikes.html"> Go to bikes pagees </a>
```

and in `vehicles/bikes.html` I would write the path of `index` page as

```xml
<a href="../index.html"> Go to homepage </a>
```

**My directory structure looks like this. The folder for my website is** `links-and-navigation` .

### What is the navigation within the page?

There are links on a page when clicked scroll the page and takes you to the desired location within that page.

[See the example page here, click on the links of vegetable names and notice the scrolling effect](https://webd-essentials.github.io/HTML5/links-and-navigation/vegetables.html)

üí† [Here is the source code of the above page](https://github.com/WebD-Essentials/HTML5/tree/links-and-navigation/vegetables.html)

**Now, how you can code this in your webpage:**

There are two steps to it

* Give an `id` to the targeted content, which is somewhere on your webpage
    
    ```xml
    <div id="mango">
    Mango is the king of fruits
    </div>
    ```
    
* add a link, wherever you want ( within the same page ) and pass that id with `#` prefix.
    
    ```xml
    <a href="#mango"> take me to the mango content </a>
    ```
    

> ‚ö°`id` attribute should be unique within a page.
> 
> Two tags or html elements can't have same id.
