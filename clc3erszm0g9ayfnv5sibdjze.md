# The way I learned programming 🧑‍💻

Hello everyone 👋,

As a full-stack web developer, I always get questions like

* how did I learn to code? 🤔
    
* and how they can be a web developer 😊
    

I give them a straightforward answer that goes like this,  learn HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript and make projects, and learning ten-finger typing can be a plus point.

### Why we are writing this blog series 💫

Learning is an endless process, it's never going to end. We are going to hand over the tools, so enough that you can use them to further increase your understanding. We want you to start building a meaningful simple project as soon as possible. When you will be doing the projects (simpler ones in the beginning), you will be learning a lot, just by google searches of (“How I can do this”).

### Prerequisites ⚒️

* a PC (obviously)
    
* VSCode installed in it or any other editor will also work ( even notepad will do the work)
    
* Curiosity to explore ( this is more important! )
    

### There are four basic things that we will be discussing 🌐

1. HTML5
    
2. CSS3
    
3. Javascript
    
4. Making projects
    

### How to learn ✨

I have a way of learning that is different from that of schools. In schools, they teach the basics first and then combine the basics to make something that is required. What I want is, first show me the thing that is required, like show me the bicycle first then teach me about the seats, paddles, stands, wheels and chain.

Basically, I follow a top-to-the-bottom approach and I apply that approach in learning new techs too. I like the blogs where they show the code first.

> ⚡Copy-pasting is the best skill you could have

### Top-to-bottom approach to learning ⬇️

Here is what you have to do, Have a little bit of knowledge of the tech or at least be aware of why you are using it. Then, set up the code unconsciously ( copy-pasting will also work ), check if it works, and gives the desired output. Here, everything is connected and working,  now start analyzing each bit and start reading about them. When you will start reading the docs or any blog or watching any tutorial, you already know it's doing something, but you will get clarity on how it's working and doing that thing.

### Be aware of your surrounding ♨️

When I was developing my first portfolio website, I read the whole MaterializeCSS docs, so that my mind should be aware of the things that exist.

Let's come to the four points I mentioned earlier

### 1️⃣ HTML5

It is the basic building block of a website. ( You can think of it as bones if you consider the website a human body).  Learn what is it, why it exists and its basic concept, no need to master it

### 2️⃣ CSS3

It is used to style and give a nice appearance to those HTML pages ( You can think of it as flesh, hairs on the human body so that HTML pages don't look like skeletons)

### 3️⃣ Javascript

It is used to give functions, sense, and consciousness to that body.

It is a programming language.

You need to learn two things about it

* first is the concepts of programming and
    
* the second one is DOM manipulation ( manipulation of HTML elements, on some condition like button pressed ).
    

### 4️⃣ Making Projects

Pick up an idea, and start making it, it can be as simple as you want. Your only purpose should be to apply the knowledge you currently have.

> ⚡Practice makes everyone perfect

### Handling errors ⚠️

If you are getting any error, just copy and paste that error into the google search box.

The best places to go for doubts are [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and the google search box.

### I want something in my project, but I don't know how to put it 🔎

Just google it, what's in your mind, in your own words, if you can’t frame a technical sentence.

### Is there everything on google? 🧭

The developers' community is growing for years and google has everyone’s doubts, solutions, and blogs.

This is beyond programming but listen, it's the 21st century with 8 billion people and more than 8 if we count the dead ones but the internet has their knowledge stored.

You are not the only person with that problem/doubt. Find it on google, you will get the solution, related to it if not exactly.

> ⚡ when I’m referencing projects, don't make up your mind for something big like AI, crypto, or machine learning kinds of stuff, let just it be simple in the beginning, it can be a card or quiz app.

I will be posting blogs on this publication "[Webd Essentials](https://webdessentials.hashnode.dev/)", be tuned and learn with.
