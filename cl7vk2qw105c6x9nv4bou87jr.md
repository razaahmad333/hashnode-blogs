# Open Source & Me

## What is open source?
Basically, they are free pieces of code, packages, and software that people use in daily life without paying for them. 
 #### examples:
 VLC media player, Linux, ReactJS, VScode, etc.

## The Idea
The idea here is that these open source things are written by developers all around the world and If you have the necessary skills* you can contribute too and make the world a better place by improving these softwares.<br/>
There are approx 200,000 open source projects out there.

## The Skills & Contribution
* **the no-code way**: provide feedback, find out the bugs in the software, or suggest some cool features. It is as important as writing codes.
* **the code way**: search the open source projects on GitHub which meet your skills and check out their `issues` tab.

## Mistakes I made, when I was getting started
* I was not aware of the no-code way and thought I'm not ready for this.
* I never checked the issues tab in those repositories.
* Even if I checked, I never read about any issues and tried to understand them.
* I was not aware that, I can be a part of the discussion on any issue with my current knowledge and experience.
* I thought it would be quick and easy to contribute in a code way. Actually, contributing to a good project is matter of weeks and months.
* I never joined any of their community (discord, slack etc) and asked anything.
* I was not consistent and persistent. 

## Why it's important to contribute?
* **Humanity**: You are using something for free, so you must feel grateful and try to contribute.
* **Community**: you get to talk to people all around the world, and believe me it feels awesome. 
* **Connections & Job opportunities**: you get to make connections and connections can be a great source for jobs.

## My open source journey 
I don't remember exactly when I came to know about open source. But I can put my stake on GSOC and any random YouTuber guy some 2 years ago. <br/>
I told you about mistakes I made, which you can prevent. <br/>
5 months ago, I came under influence of [Kunal Kushwaha](https://twitter.com/kunalstwt), 
who taught me the concept of learning in public, making connections and building communities by sharing what you are working on and helping others. <br/>
Recently, I have started an open source project [algebra-for-you](https://www.npmjs.com/package/algebra-for-you), you can contribute in it if you want.<br/>
Currently, I'm not an open source master but trying my best.
<br/>

I hope you got to know a little bit about open source.
