# Let's use a js package 🎁

> 🚩 we would only discuss about javascript packages

## What is a package? 🤔
It is a piece of code written by some smart people which does something.
If you want that functionality without writing all the code by yourself, you can use that particular package.

#### for example 🖊️
you are creating a website and at some point, you need to check if the email entered by the user is valid or not, <br>
You have two potential ways,
* either you write a function by yourself

```js
function isEmail(emailString) {
    // check for @ sign
    var atSymbol = emailString.indexOf("@");
    if(atSymbol < 1) return false;
    
    var dot = emailString.indexOf(".");
    if(dot <= atSymbol + 2) return false;
    
    // check that the dot is not at the end
    if (dot === emailString.length - 1) return false;
    
    return true;
}

isEmail('awe@some.com'); // => true

```
* or use a package 

```js
var validator = require('validator');

validator.isEmail('awe@some.com'); //=> true
```

## How to start using a package? 🧑‍💻
#### Prerequisites
* [brief knowledge of javascript modules](https://ahmadrazakhan946.hashnode.dev/your-first-javascript-code-in-terminal)

Lets start from scratch 💫<br/>
* Create a new folder `hello-packages` anywhere on your computer <br/>
* Then open a terminal in that directory <br/>
*  run the command
```shell
npm init -y
```
* Now its time to install the package
```shell
  npm install validator
```
* create a file `index.js` and paste this code in that file
```js
const validator = require('validator');
console.log(validator.isEmail('some@thing.com'));
```

At this time, your directory should look like
```js
/**
* hello-packages
* -- node_modules
* -- index.js
* -- package-lock.json
* -- package.json
*/
```

* run the code inside `index.js` file
```shell
 node index.js
```
* output you will get is 
```shell
true
```

[check this out](https://blogs.m3rashid.in/blogs/package-json) to know what a package.json file is 


## Using a package in a project that doesn't use modules but static HTML files
you can use their cdn `https://unpkg.com/validator@latest/validator.min.js`
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/validator@latest/validator.min.js"></script>
```
Add a script tag in your HTML head with cdn url.

## How to check what features and functionality a package offer? 🪶
Most of them have great documentation. <br/>
or you can check out their GitHub repositories.

## Who writes these packages? 🧠
Smart people like you and me. <br/>
Most of the packages are free to install, and you can contribute to their GitHub repos.<br>


## What is npm?
npm stands for node package manager. <br>
It is a command line client. which means that 
you can use it to 
* install a package   `npm install validator`
* uninstall a package ` npm uninstall validator`
* publish a package   ` npm publish `
* and a lot more         `npm -h`

It is also an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).
