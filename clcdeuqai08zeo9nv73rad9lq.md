# Texts, headings and paragraphs in HTML üìú

You can display texts on your webpage in various formats using HTML, such as:

* Headings
    
* Paragraphs
    
* bold and italic texts, etc
    

> ‚ö° Try copy-pasting the codes of this blog on [W3Schools Tryit Playground,](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_basic) Try different combinations, and see output instantly.

### Headings ü¶í

There is a series of heading tags ( h1 to h6 ) to show headings in different sizes.

```xml

<h1> Heading with h1</h1>
<h2> Second Heading with h2</h2>
<h3> Third Heading with h3</h3>
<h4> Fourth Heading with h4</h4>
<h5> Fifth Heading with h5</h5>
<h6> Sixth Heading with h6</h6>
```

**The Output:**

You can also change the boldness and hugeness of these headings using CSS.

> ‚ö° You are not bound to use these tags. You can style your own text to look the way you want using CSS.

### Paragraphs üêê

Simply add paragraphs using `<p> </p>` tag

```xml
<p>
    You can write a paragraph of text here.
</p>

<p>
    You can write another paragraph of text here.
</p>

<h3>
    Heading to the third paragraph
</h3>

<p>
    You can write third paragraph of text here.
</p>
```

**The Output:**

### Formatting Tags üëë

Here are some tags you can use to give style to your text without adding CSS styling.

```xml
<b>1. This is shown bold</b>
<br>
<strong>2. This is shown strong</strong>
<br>
<i>3. This is shown italic</i>
<br>
<em>4. This is shown emphasized</em>
<br>
<mark>5. This is shown marked</mark>
<br>
<small>6. This is shown small</small>
<br>
<del>7. This is shown deleted</del>
<br>
<ins>8. This is shown inserted</ins>
<br>
<sub>9. This is shown subscript</sub>
<br>
<span>
    10. H<sub>2</sub>O
</span>
<br>
<sup>11. This is shown superscript</sup>
<br>
<span>
    12. a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>
</span>
<br>
<u>13. This is shown underlined</u>
<br>
<code> 14. console.log("this is javascript code"); </code>
```

**The output:**

I have used `<br>` tags in between them to add line breaks.

If `<br>` tags were not used they would come in a single line because they are **inline** tags.

You can see **heading** and **paragraph** tags, they are in different lines irrespective of their content width because they are **block** tags. A block tag automatically adds a line break after their content.

### Block and Inline Tags üì¶

You are now aware of what block and inline tags are.

Basically, **block-level tags** occupy the whole width of the screen. And the next tags are allowed to display in the next line.

And **inline-level tags** occupy the width equal to their size of content and allow the next tag to display after them in the same line.

### HTML Entities üíé

There are entities to add spacing and symbols in HTML.

For example, `&nbsp;` adds space in the texts.

```xml
<p> It &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is &#160; unevenly &nbsp; &nbsp; spaced &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sentence. </p>
```

**The output would be:**

`It ¬† ¬† ¬† is unevenly ¬† ¬† spaced ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† sentence.`

We cannot simply add spaces in our code without using `&nbsp;` or `&#160` .

> ‚ö°use preformatted tag &lt;pre&gt; if you want to display a sentence with line breaks, as you put them in code &lt;/pre&gt;
> 
> It prints texts as it is with spaces and line breaks in the code.

```xml
<p> 9 &gt; 6 &amp; 7 &lt; 8, and reward is &quot; &pound;1000 &quot;. </p>
```

**The output would be:**

`5 > 6 & 7 < 8, and reward is " ¬£1000 ".`

**Here are some entities with their name and number:**

[checkout more about entities at w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp).

**Q: Why do entities have names and numbers both?**

**A:** Browsers may not support all entity names, but the support for entity numbers is good.
