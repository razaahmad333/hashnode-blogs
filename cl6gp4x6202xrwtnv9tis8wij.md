# 2 years of Online Classes ✍️

Yes, <br>
due to covid, my two years of classes were online.

## was it better for me?
Probably, yes 😊.

## 🤔 Why?
Because I loved programming and did what I wished to do 💖
* making project
* learning any new skill
* reading any book
* doing freelancing
* going for interviews  


## So lets start from beginning 👈

* ### 1st semester 👶
After admission, I was added to a WhatsApp group. <br>
There I met all of my classmates, but the group was like ( Only admin can send messages ). <br>
After talking to few of them, **I** created an unofficial group for our class ( Section E ).
We held online meets and games. <br><br>
In the meantime, I created my [first portfolio website](https://compassionate-mccarthy-aacaae.netlify.app/index.html).<br>
And this semester lasted for 2.5 months. ( you can dm me and I can explain it. )

* ### 2nd semester 🧑‍🎓
This time, I was into Blender ( the 3d design kinda stuff) and academics.<br>
I was completing my assignments the day they get assigned and sharing them with all of my classmates. <br>
I took courses on [probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzkc-qNVoOk&list=PLC58778F28211FA19) and  [statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhxtUt_-GyM&list=PL1328115D3D8A2566) from khanAcademy youtube channel. <br>
I also watched CrashCourse's playlist on [Philosophy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&list=PLUHoo4L8qXthO958RfdrAL8XAHvk5xuu9), [Psychology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo4pMVb0R6M&list=PLGMVCsud2sqX1F5BkUp7yiIFcGtFjb1hZ) and [Economics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I_-ADGrKQo&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtPNZwz5_o_5uirJ8gQXnhEO). <br>
I watched CrashCourse videos twice in order to get it because english was not my native language. <br>
One of the advantages of all these was that it increased my attention span and improved my listening skill. <br>
Due to covid, I saw the deaths of many close relatives this semester.

* ### 3rd semester 🧑‍💻
This time, I was into coding and making projects and a lot of healthy mistakes. <br>
I explored React, Firebase and RestAPI, and made a lot of projects. <br>
These days were so damn hard for me ( mentally). 
I was coding for 12 to 13 hours a day. 
If I got stuck on any problem and after trying a few solutions, I used to go to bed thinking it's impossible and I can't do it. But the next morning, when I use to try the problems and after a few google searches it gets solved. <br>
I am grateful for every single concept and skill I have learned.<br> 
I created my Upwork profile and got 2 to 3 clients too . <br>

* ### 4th semester 👨‍🏭 
I joined my first internships at [Meta16labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/meta16labs)
thanks to [Shoeb Ilyas](https://www.shoebilyas.com). <br>
There, I learned a lot of things. It was a startup so the opportunity to learn new things was abundant. <br>

* ### after 4th semester (online classes) and before 5th semester (offline classes) 📰
This was the time, I got active on LinkedIn, Twitter, and hashnode. <br>
I shared my experiences of internship and programming on these platforms. <br>
In search of open-source, I started my own open-source npm package [algebra-for-you](https://www.npmjs.com/package/algebra-for-you). <br>

> 🙋‍♂️ NOTE : The boundaries of semester I have defined are not that absolute.

> I learned all of the skills free of cost on youtube and other free resources. ( I don't know I need to mention this or not but anyway😅 I loved the journey and looking for further exciting things to happen).
