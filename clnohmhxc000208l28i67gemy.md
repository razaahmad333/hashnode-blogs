Hey there,  
I hope you are doing well.

Today is October 11, 2023, and I'm working on an open-source project called "json-server-admin-dashboard." In simple terms, it's a user-friendly admin dashboard for people who are using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) or [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) in their learning process of web development and API. This tool helps them easily manage their data without any hassle.

### Why do I need it?

if you're diving into **web development** and getting the hang of **integrating APIs** into your web app's frontend using tools like **fetch**, **axios**, or **AJAX** for making **HTTP requests**, you might want some APIs to experiment with.

Well, there's this fantastic tool called json-server that lets you create a mock REST API in a mere 30 seconds, and the best part is, you don't have to write a single line of backend code. All you have do is install the json-server npm package globally and create a JSON file right on your local machine, call it db.json.

Here is a glance at Getting Started from json-server GitHub page.

And you get all these APIs to play with:

### When do I need the project you are working on?

So, in this setup, your database is essentially stored within the db.json file. The project I'm working on "json-server-admin-dashboard," is designed to offer a user-friendly graphical interface for interacting with that data. It lets you perform actions like creating, updating, and deleting data within the database.  
Here is, how it looks ( in its early age of development ).

You can think of it as a management interface system similar to how MySQL Workbench is used for MySQL or MongoDB Compass for MongoDB. It's all about simplifying the process of working with your JSON-based database.

Use these tools and make your learning process smooth and entertaining and easy.
