# The story of the Internet and HTML🌐

### The Context 🧭

Before the internet, there was a time when researchers used to write their papers on physical paper. To share those papers, they have to send them physically; and once the paper was received the sender can't make edits.

### The Idea 💡

After the introduction of personal computers, the sharing of information became painless. Once they established a network, they could share files between them.

The idea of sharing files or say research papers across universities and countries originated and this is how the INTERNET came into existence.

### Need of HTML? 🤔

At that time, there was a need for a type of file that could contain all the things that a research paper has such as

* headings
    
* subheadings
    
* italic and bold words in a line
    
* diagram and images
    
* and the list can go on and on...
    

A text document was unable to fulfill these requirements.

In 1993, a smart and intelligent guy invented HTML documents a type of file that could have all the things that a nice and awesome research paper has.

To write such types of files one had to follow the rules of HTML.

It became the building block of web pages.

> ⚡The awesome thing that HTML documents facilitated was embedding links to other documents.

### The Solution - a method 🔎

Computers were upgraded and a method was developed to share files across universities.

Now, if a researcher wants to share his papers, he/she could create a **special** folder "The\_Server" on his computer, with all the papers into it written in HTML.

Then he/she could share his computer's IP address with the public or selected individuals.

> ⚡ Creating a folder named "The\_Server" on your computer will not do work. I have tried to make it simple, so that you get an idea about how the things work. Here, IP address is synonym to links ( URLs )

### The convenience 😊

Now the reader enters the IP address of his favorite researcher into the browser and was able to read their papers.

A paper used to have links, that directs them to other research papers for reference. One can easily read a lot of related papers on a single computer screen.

This was revolutionizing 🔥.

### The web 🕸️

In a few years, thousands of HTML documents were created and connected to each other through links. And this is why the term "World Wide Web" came into existence.

### What is a server? 📤📥

That researcher's computer is known as a server because it is 'serving' the files requested through its IP address.

### What is a web page? 📜

An HTML file opened in the browser is known as a web page.

### What is a website? 🛖

It can be considered a collection of web pages.
