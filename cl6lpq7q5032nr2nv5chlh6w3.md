# Making of my first portfolio website

#### How did it start? 🤔

In my first year of college, I was already into coding and programming.  
I have learned Javascript, React, and HTML. But I wanted to do freelancing.  

For that every guy on youtube ( the only source of guidance at that time ) said first you must have a portfolio website, It makes you look unique and professional. 👨‍💼  
The problem was, that I had not any idea about deployment.  
So I searched it on youtube and saw a video by [Dev Ed](https://twitter.com/developedbyed).  
And deploying a static HTML website was as easy as dragging and dropping. I was flattered. 🤗

#### How it went? ⚒️

My CSS was not good at that time, so I thought to use a CSS framework.⛏️  
I was pretty good at bootstrap but thought to explore and learn a new one.  
So I picked up [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com).  
I went through the whole documentation in a single day.  
I opened up my VSCode and started typing codes. 🧑‍💻  
After two days it was ready. A 3-page simple static mobile-friendly HTML website.

Now it was time for hosting. ☁️  
I opened up [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), created an account, and dropped my folder into that, within a second a public URL was ready for my portfolio website.  
I was very excited, it was a dream come true for me.🔮  
It was like, I have jumped to the next level in my life because for me the deployment was a very big thing.  

I showed it to everyone I knew and shared it on WhatsApp. I got replies like "what's this", and "I don't know what is this about", but I was happy.

#### How it is going? 🚶‍♂️

After that, I created two more portfolio websites and a lot of projects.  
I will share insights into these things in my upcoming blogs.  
Will see you next time.

#### A little bit of Philosophy! 📖

How to create happiness?  
First, create an expectation and then achieve that.
